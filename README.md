# Open Hosting Project


In this project we provide users free hosting.

Key points: 
1. In our project User can make free blog. 
2. We will allow unlimited subdomain for users.
3. Users can save images, HTML, js, css and any other file. We will impose restrictions on the maximum file size for a single file as Fair Usage Policy
4. No hosting providers let anyone to execute Python code for managing requests for URLs(only VPS and Dedicated servers provide this functionality). When a visitor requests a URL from a blog the user can customize the response page using small python code. But this optional feature for users.
5. We will have a books sub-section where authors can write books and post on our website users can view it with ads and author gets paid. Note here neither the author nor reader is paying anything.
6. Users will be able to add eye candy website by adding components from our design store. This store will contain HTML DOM Elements with special design(eg: button with animations). These will be priced by designers. So here designers can earn.

How we will monetize:
We will promote some blogs on our main website when it is ready.
We take a slice from designer's earnings.
We will partner with ads  company and provide ads for bloggers so that they can earn and we will take a slice from their ad income.
User will be charged if their python function is doing a lot of extra work which violates our fair usage Policy and if they want to host a really big project(which only a corporate/business would do).
